				<h2>Support the development</h2>
				<p>
					It was fun experimenting with Thunderbird (TB) internals when I first decided to rewrite XNote++ to support the latest TB version about four years ago.
					This was mainly because I was an XNote++ user myself and was disappointed when it stopped working due to changes in TB internals.
				</p>

				<p>
					And now, again, some breaking changes have been made to TB internals, so much so that another rewrite was required to support the latest TB versions.
				</p>

				<p>
					I really hate to ask for donations, but it has come to this.
					In all honesty, I'm not sure if I still want to (or can) spend so much time developing this extension.
					If this extension brings you any value, please consider sending a donation.
				</p>

				<p>
					To put things into perspective: it took around one month of full-time development to bring this extension up to date yet again.
					If all current QNote users donated 1â‚¬ (or $1), this could cover the latest rewrite and then some.
				</p>

				<p>
					Thank you to all who have already donated!
